#  Retail Performance Analysis  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales performance using **SQL, Excel, and Power BI**.  
The main goal is to understand business KPIs such as revenue growth, customer segmentation, and product performance.  

I built an end-to-end pipeline starting from raw sales data â†’ cleaning with SQL â†’ quick checks in Excel â†’ and finally creating an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for insights.

##  Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and transformation using SQL queries.  
- Use Excel for validation, pivot tables, and initial summaries.  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** that tracks sales KPIs (total revenue, monthly trends, top products, regional performance).  
- Deliver insights that can help management improve decision-making.
